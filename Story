in the middle of a heavy storm.
Your phone is on 5% and you don't have service.
ahead of you there is a large metal gate full of vines.
you press on the gate and it slowly swings open.
you see a road leading to a large plantation style mansion there is light coming from a window on the second floor.
you use your phone to light your way to the house.
you get to the front door the house looks very old and run down but you hear voices coming from inside the house.
you knock on the door and the voices cease.
you hear footsteps approaching the door.
the doorknob turns and slowly creeks open.
